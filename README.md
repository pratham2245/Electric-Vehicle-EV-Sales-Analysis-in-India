This project analyzes Electric Vehicle (EV) sales data in India to understand adoption trends, regional performance, and vehicle category contribution.  
The analysis follows a **professional data analyst workflow**, focusing on trends, KPIs, and business insights.

---

##  Objective
The objective of this project is to:
- Analyze EV sales growth over time
- Identify top-performing states
- Understand vehicle category contribution
- Highlight regional and market concentration patterns
- Support data-driven decisions for EV infrastructure and policy planning

---

##  Dataset Description
The dataset contains EV sales information across Indian states, including:
- Date (Year / Month)
- State
- Vehicle Category / Type
- EV Sales Quantity

Each record represents EV sales for a specific state and time period.

---

##  Key Focus Areas
- Year-wise and month-wise EV sales trends  
- State-wise EV adoption analysis  
- Vehicle category contribution (2W, 3W, 4W, etc.)  
- Growth analysis and trend comparison  
- Pareto (80/20) analysis of state-wise sales  

---

##  Data Cleaning & Preparation
Key preprocessing steps include:
- Handling missing and inconsistent values  
- Converting date columns to datetime format  
- Creating time-based features (Year, Month)  
- Standardizing numeric sales columns  

---

##  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualizations created in this project include:
- Year-wise EV sales trend  
- Top 10 states by EV sales  
- EV sales by vehicle category  
- Growth comparison across states  
- Pareto curve for sales concentration  

---

##  Key Insights
- EV adoption is increasing rapidly over time  
- A few states contribute the majority of EV sales  
- Two-wheelers dominate EV adoption in India  
- Sales show clear regional concentration  

---

##  Business Use & Impact
Insights from this analysis help:
- Policymakers plan EV incentives  
- Companies prioritize charging infrastructure deployment  
- Manufacturers identify high-growth regions  
- Support strategic EV market expansion  

---

##  Tools & Technologies Used
- Python  
- Pandas & NumPy  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

##  Conclusion
This project provides a clear view of EV adoption trends in India, highlighting regional leaders and dominant vehicle categories. The analysis supports strategic decision-making for infrastructure development, policy planning, and EV market growth.
